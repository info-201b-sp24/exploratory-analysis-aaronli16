calculated from your summary information R script

### Table

Include a table of aggregate information

Describe why you included the table and what information it reveals

### Chart 1

**Description:**

This bar chart shows the average number of drinks consumed per night out
by students from different majors.

**Reason for Choosing a Bar Chart:**

I chose to use a bar chart to depict the data between average drinks per
night out and major because it is easy to read and understand. The bar
chart allows the reader to quickly identify which bar corresponds to
which major and see their average drinks per night. It also clearly
shows which majors have higher or lower average numbers of drinks per
night. When comparing a category with many options, such as academic
majors, it is important to ensure the viewer can easily distinguish
between the different categories. The bar chart achieves this by
providing a straightforward visual comparison.

### Chart 2

**Description:**

This box plot illustrates the relationship between the average GPA of
students in the year 2023 and their reported number of drinks consumed
per night out.

**Reason for Choosing a box plot chart:**

A box plot is used here to show how GPA varies across different levels
of alcohol consumption. It gives a clear picture of the central values,
median GPA, and spread of GPA within each group of drinks per night out.
This makes it easy to see if there are any patterns or differences in
GPA based on how much students drink. Box plots work well for comparing
a continuous variable, such as GPA, with a categorical variable, such as
drinks per night out, making it easy to understand the relationship
between them.
